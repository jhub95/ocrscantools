See tesseract-train for details of rebuilding the tesseract language data

# To word-diff two files
wdiff --no-common pdfout/009.txt text/009.txt
perhaps with the -s option to ignore spaces

# To test a book scan against a pdf do something like:
pdftotext -layout /home/mark/documents/Work\ Abroad/Turkey/Books/Jerry_Mattix/Allah_Sevgidir/orig/Allah\ Sevgidir-son.pdf - | perl ../../script/splitter.pl
cd pdfout
for i in *; do wdiff  --no-common $i ../text/$i; done |wc -l
