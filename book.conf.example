# even_detect_crop/odd_detect_crop - specify the crops to run on the input
# images before even running page detection. This is based on imagemagick crop
# format (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#crop)
#
# For the book scanner this is typically required to get page detection working
# correctly on the right-hand pages:
even_detect_crop = 94.5%x100%+0+0

# odd_blank_page/even_blank_page: Specify blank pages to use for scan
# lighting/background removal. These are not required but strongly advised as
# they significantly improve the output and OCR quality. The closer to the
# middle of the book they are the better.
odd_blank_page = 083.jpg
even_blank_page = 002.jpg

# path: Which directory are the raw input files in. Defaults to 'raw'
# path = raw_input

# Specify middle_no_crop if the page boundaries are very close to the spine -
# increases the area of readable text in to the center of the book
#
# middle_no_crop = 1

# Level adjustment:
# Specifying which color levels should just be assumed to be white and which
# should be assumed to be black makes the image clearer, improves OCR and
# reduces file size. These are based on the imagemagick level command
# (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#level).
#
# The default of:
# level = 50%,98%
#
# Means that anything less than 50% brightness will darkened, whereas anything
# close to white will be set to full white.

# Language setting (at the moment tur/eng allowed)
# language = tur

# PDF-only options
#
# For PDF files you can control levels of the the PDF output using
# 'output-level' option (see 'level' above).  It will default to the same as
# 'level' if not specified.
#
# Page sizing (DPI specification)
# input-dpi specifies what the dpi of the input is. This is used for scaling
# the PDF's we output ie if an image is 720px high and 72dpi then it would be
# 10 inch page size output.
#
# input-dpi = 400
#
# The ratio of pdf-dpi:input-dpi defines how much we scale the image we include
# in the PDF output. So for example if input-dpi is 300 and pdf-dpi is 150 then
# we would reduce the quality of the PDF's included image to 50% of original
# size (but keeping page size the same). This is because 
# pdf-dpi = 140

# Output image compression quality options:
# For PDF's we want to heavily compress the images to reduce file size. For b&w
# text a quality of 20 produces some visible artifacts but generally allows the
# text to still be readable. For pictures we want more like 50 or 60 for
# vaguely decent quality. If your scan contains grayscale images you should
# perhaps raise the grayscale quality to 50 and reprocess the pdf.
#
# pdf-grayscale-quality = 20
# pdf-color-quality = 50
