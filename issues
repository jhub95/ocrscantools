* Should auto-detect images and not apply the level adjustment to those areas of the picture..

* eg 159/104.png cropped cuts off last char of every line - probably due to 50px extra crop - perhaps disable for some sides ??
* How to auto-detect white pages (and choose best one) ? Take auto cropped img & then check info: and then do a fuzzy crop thing to find the best?
* Can we auto-detect levels? Small blur (3px?) then histogram to see where the black/white parts are & run over all imgs?

Anadolu Azizleri:
* Towards end even pages are triangled - distort needs correcting
* Images pretty dark

760:
* even crop detect includes red area so pages are skewed (at first anyway)

* Because paper is old lots of specks - perhaps try to remove them somehow?
* Some page borders overcropped down middle (?)

General
* Often it assumes font size is changing very quickly so confused by ', " or .....'s
* Add in double arrows for quotes to allowed/trained chars
* Perhaps some algo to detect triangled pages and correct ?

* Bug with pdfunite so that sometimes first few words of page are not output to PDF text file
